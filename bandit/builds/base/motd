          Welcome! You're patched in to the BANDIT.

Use your skills as the ultimate hacker to progress through this year's
BANDIT BANDIT style challenges. If you haven't played OverTheWire
Bandit before, do not worry, we'll start it off easy. Manouevre through 
the challenges, apply your Linux prowess, find the misconfigurations, 
vulnerabilities, and sensitive information to reach the end.

You are currently bandit0. Your objective is to find the password for
the next user with your current user's access. The first challenge is
simple but the difficulty will increase. The password for the next user
will be located in /etc/bandit/[username]/password, but only the 
[username] has access to their password. Once you find the password, 
submit the flag to the CTF scoreboard and use it to login as the next
user. 

          Good................................Bye.
